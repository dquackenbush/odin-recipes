    <h2>Churros are delightful Spanish pastries, deep-fried until golden and dusted with cinnamon sugar, known for their crispy exterior and soft, doughy interior, often served with a side of chocolate or caramel sauce for dipping.</h2>

    <p>"These churros are crispy on the outside, yet wonderfully tender on the inside. This restaurant-worthy churro recipe will quickly become a staple in your dessert rotation.</p>

    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below." - Delia</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 quarts oil for frying</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, 2 ½ tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a small saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Stir in flour, stirring until mixture forms a ball.</li>
        <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Carefully pipe a few 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot oil; work in batches so you don't crowd the fryer. Cook until golden; use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer churros to paper towels to drain.</li>
        <li>Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and sugar mixture.</li>
    </ol>
