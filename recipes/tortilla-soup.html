    <h2>Chicken tortilla soup is a flavorful Mexican-inspired dish featuring shredded chicken, tomatoes, beans, corn, and spices, garnished with crispy tortilla strips and various toppings.</h2>

    <p>"If there were a Mount Rushmore for chicken soups, this is on it. Although, I’m guessing carving a bowl of soup into a rock mountain face would be a lot tougher than a face. Anyway, the point is, this is a really good soup."</p>

    <p> I hope you find the time to make it from scratch, but if you don’t, you’ll still be able to experience most of the awesomeness. If you use some high-quality chicken broth, and find some not-terribly-dry cooked chicken, you should be in decent shape. We’ll even let you break up some store-bought tortilla chips to finish the soup if you have to, but it’s so much better if you make your own crispy noodle-like strips. - John Mitzewich</p>
